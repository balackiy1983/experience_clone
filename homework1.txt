'number' + 3 + 3// = 'number33'
Since the number is a string, the string 'number', the number 3 and the number 3 will be concatenated.

null + 3// = 3
In this expression, null is converted to a number because you use the addition operator + with a number. null is converted to 0 because JavaScript converts null to 0 when used with arithmetic operators.

5 && "qwerty"// = "qwerty"
The result is because 5 and "qwerty" are both true values (not zero and not empty).

+'40' + +'2' + "hillel"// = "42hillel"
'40 'becomes a number because it is preceded by a unary plus (+). The result of this operation will be the number 40.
'2' is also converted to a number because it is preceded by a unary plus (+). The result of this operation will be the number 2.
After that, the operation of adding numbers occurs: 40 + 2 = 42.
Next, the resulting number and the string "hillel" are concatenated

'10' - 5 === 6// =  false
'10' - 5 first a subtraction operation occurs. The string '10' is automatically converted to a number because you subtract the number 5 from it. The result of this operation will be the number 5.
The result of the previous operation (5) is compared with the number 6 using the strict comparison operator = = =. This operator checks if both operands are equal in value and data type. In this case, 5 is not equal to 6, so this operation will return false.

true + false// = 1
The expression true + false in JavaScript will be 1 + 0, since the logical value true in JavaScript is converted to the number 1, and the logical value false is converted to the number 0 in arithmetic operations. Thus, the result of the expression will be 1.

'4px' - 3// = NaN
Subtract the number 3 from the string '4px'. Since the string '4px' cannot be converted to a number directly, JavaScript will try to convert the string to a number, and if this is not possible, the result will be NaN.

'4' - 3// = 1
In this case, the string '4' is converted to a number because you subtract the number 3 from the string, which looks like a number. Therefore, the result will be a numerical operation 4-3 equal to 1.

'6' + 3 ** 0// ='7' 
The ** operator in JavaScript raises a number to a power. Therefore, 3 ** 0 is equal to 1, since any number raised to the zero power will always be 1. Thus, the expression '6' + 3 * * 0 will turn the string '6' into the number 6 (since there is a numeric value next to the operator +), and then perform the operation of adding the number 6 and the number 1. The result is the number 7, which is automatically converted to a string because you use the + operator for strings.

12 / '6'// = 2
The number 12 is divided by a number that is automatically converted from the string '6' to the number 6.

'10' + (5 === 6)// = '10false'
In this expression, a comparison operation of 5 === 6 will occur first, which will return a Boolean value false since 5 is not equal to 6. This is followed by a string concatenation operation because one of the operands is a string. Thus, the result will be the string '10false', where false was converted to a string for concatenation.

null == ''// = true
In JavaScript, the == operator compares two values with the consideration of type reduction. In the expression null == '' null and '' belong to different data types: null is a special value that indicates no value, and ''(empty string) is a string value. Therefore, null is first converted to a number (if required) or ''to a number (if required) before comparison. In the case of null == '' null is converted to 0, and '' to 0, since an empty string is converted to 0 when compared with numbers. Therefore, the expression null == '' will be true.

3 ** (9 / 3)// = 27
In this expression, a division operation of 9/3 equal to 3 is performed first. Then the operation of raising to the power of 3 * * 3, equal to 27, is performed.

!!'false' == !!'true'// = true
This expression checks if both Boolean values 'false' and 'true' can be converted to true.
!!'false' - double application of the operator ! converts the string 'false' to a boolean value of false and then back to true. That is, !!'false' becomes true.
!!'true' - double application of the operator ! converts the string 'true' to a boolean value of false and then to true again. That is, !! 'true' becomes true.
So !!'false' == !!'true' is a true expression because both values can be converted to true.

0 || '0' && 1// = 1
When evaluating this expression, the & & (logical AND) operation is performed first.
'0' is converted to true because it is not an empty string. This is followed by an & & operation between '0' (which is true) and 1, which results in 1.
Thus, the expression is simplified to 0 | | 1, where:
0 is converted to false
1 becomes true.
In operation || (logical "OR"), the result is the first operand that is true, or the last if all operands are false. So the result of the expression 0 || '0' && 1 is 1.

(+null == false) < 1// = false
+ null converts null to a number, so the result of this operation will be 0.
0 = = false-The = = = operator compares values based on type reduction. In this case, both values can be reduced to a number, and 0 and false are converted to 0. Thus, this operation will be true.
Compare true < 1-The < operator compares numbers. Convert true to 1 and get 1 < 1, which is a false operation.

false && true || true// = true
false && true - The && operator returns the first value if it is false, otherwise it returns the second value. In this case, the result is false, since one of the operands (false) is false.
Further, the expression false || true - the operator || returns the first value if it is converted to true, otherwise returns the second value. In this case, the result is true because one of the operands (true) is true.

false && (false || true)// = false
First, an operation is performed inside the brackets, that is, false | | true, which returns true, since one of the operands is true.
Then a logical AND (& &) operation is performed between false and the result of the operation inside parentheses (true). The & & & operator will return false because one of the operands is false.

(+null == false) < 1 ** 5// = true
+ null converts null to a number, the result is 0. 0 == false is compared, which is true because both values are converted to 0. The comparison operator < compares the result of the previous comparison with 1 * * 5, which is 1. The expression 0 < 1 is also true.
